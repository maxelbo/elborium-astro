  ## Daito Trust Construction
  <p>
    I made five landing pages for Daito Trust Construction. I was given only the
    mobile version of the design, and developed it based on that, designing the
    desktop version while coding.

  ## Tokyo Bureau of Social Welfare
  <p>
    I developed a website to look up information about facilities in Tokyo for
    the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's Bureau of Social Welfare. I built the
    frontend with LWC and SASS. The data is stored in Salesforce. The data
    structure was not decided when I started working on the project, so I got to
    design the data structure when writing the filtering and pagination logic.
