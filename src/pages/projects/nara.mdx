I was responsible for the frontend development and design of the **Narakko Hagukumi App**, a CRM app developed to assist parents in Nara Prefecture, Japan, with child-rearing resources and support.

The initial phase of the project utilized Node.js, WebPack, Pug, SCSS, and JavaScript, before transitioning to Salesforce LWC.

In addition to technical development, I created illustrations for the appâ€™s hero image and onboarding screens to facilitate a user-friendly experience for parents navigating through the platform.
