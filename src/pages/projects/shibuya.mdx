I contributed to the frontend development and design of **Shibuya My Portal**, a CRM app designed to simplify and digitize interactions between citizens, businesses, and the municipal office in Shibuya Ward, Tokyo, as a part of the ward's Digital Transformation (DX) initiative.

In the project's initial stages, we employed Node.js, WebPack, Pug, SCSS, and JavaScript. Subsequently, we transitioned to Salesforce LWC.

Additionally, I made illustrations for the landing page to enhance the user interface and experience.
