body: "I was commissioned by Beletra Almanako —an esperanto literary magazine— to make a two page diagram explaining the difference between gender identity, sex, sexual or romantic orientation and gender expression for an article about riism (the use of a third gender pronoun) by Egalecen. Here I’m posting the online version. I really enjoyed working on this piece, since two of the most important people in my life are trans and need to explain this one time after another.

Thanks to Vesper, Aaron, Mo and Mia for the help!"
