body: "This was a commission for a birthday present I shipped to Chile this morning. It’s the first notebook I’ve ever made and I absolutely fell in love with bookbinding while making it. The key reads “тайна”, which means secret/mystery in Russian. I just noticed that the bound bookmark looks a tad black in the pictures, but it’s actually green."
