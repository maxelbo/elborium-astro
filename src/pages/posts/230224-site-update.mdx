body: "I combined my portfolio and blog into a single site to cut down on costs and simplify maintenance. Now, I'm using Astro and Tailwind, and I'm using React for some components. I'm deploying it on my own VPN in Nurenberg, using Github webhooks to redeploy it every time I push to the repo. I started using AWS first with Netlify, but decided to move it to Hetzner with Coolify. I'm enjoying the new setup a lot."
